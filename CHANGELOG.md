## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **ZIP Batch Upload** - Upload images in bulk via ZIP archive
  - Browser-side extraction using JSZip
  - Batch processing (50 images per batch) to prevent memory overflow
  - Real-time extraction and upload progress display
  - Unified tag setting for all images
  - Auto-skip non-image files and files over 70MB

### Changed

- Use Cloudflare Transform Images URL (`/cdn-cgi/image/...`) as a fallback WebP/AVIF delivery method when stored variants are missing (e.g. uploads over 10MB).

### Fixed

- Fix deleted images not disappearing from Upload/Manage pages without a hard refresh (TanStack Query cache + recent uploads list).
- Fix Manage page Random API generator to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` instead of the placeholder `https://your-worker.workers.dev`.
